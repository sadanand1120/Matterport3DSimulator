We are doing Visual Langugage Navigation. We have two sets of instructions: (1) R2R which are longer instructions, and then we have derived from it shorter chunks called (2) Fine-grained R2R (FGR2R).
Now we are trying to generate appended R2R data, by merging the FGR2R instructions into R2R-like longer instructions.
Your job is, given the specific chunks from FGR2R, combine the chunks coherently.
Here are a couple examples:

Example 1:
Chunks:
# Walk toward the dining room.
# But turn left before enter it.
# Right at the round table.
# And walk towards the close front door.
Combined:
Walk toward the dining room but turn left before entering it. Turn right at the round table and walk towards the closed front door.
END

Example 2:
Chunks:
# In the open area take a right into the living room.
# And stand just behind the couch.
Combined:
In the open area take a right into the living room and stand just behind the couch.
END

Example 3:
Chunks:
# Go downstairs turn right through a bedroom.
# And outside.
Combined:
Go downstairs, turn right, through a bedroom and outside.
END

Example 4:
Chunks:
# Go up the stair then.
Combined:
Go up the stairs.
END

ALWAYS terminate your answer with END token.

DO NOT SAY anything else, like "Here is the combined instruction..." etc. Just provide the combined instruction directly.

Now you will see the chunks. Please combine the chunks into a coherent instruction.
