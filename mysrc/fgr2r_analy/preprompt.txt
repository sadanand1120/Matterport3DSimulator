Context: we have natural language sub-instructions / short instructions for Visual-Language Navigation task in indoor environment such as Matterport3D R2R dataset.
Given a sub-instruction (which might be 10-15 words long), we want to decompose it into a sequence of 1-2 atomic actions. Here is the DSL we are using for defining atomic predicates:

- actions: walk(...), stop(...), turn_left(...), turn_right(...), turn_around(...), go_straight(...), etc.
- objects: any possible things in the environment, e.g., table, chair, bed, stairs, door, etc.
- positional predicates: near(...), in_front_of(...), behind(...), next_to(...), on_top_of(...), between(...), etc.
- temporal predicates: before(...), after(...), at(...), along(...), until(...), etc.

You need to use these intelligently to express the given instruction as a sequence of 2-3 atomic actions. Here are some examples:

Instruction: "stop on the patio doorway before you hit touch the stone"
Decomposition:
```python
stop(at(patio_doorway) && before(stone))
```
END

Instruction: "walk to the end of the hallway then turn left"
Decomposition:
```python
walk(until(hallway_end))
turn_left()
```
END

ALWAYS terminate your answer with END token.

You will now see the new instruction. Please decompose it as described above.
